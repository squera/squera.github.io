General Course Information This Advanced Programming course has two goals: (1) making you well-versed in a novel, advanced programming language, and (2), making you capable of developing large projects without relying solely on your code. Thus, the course will first present the Rust programming language, and then it will have a major W3C-style class-wide project.
The first part of the class will be more Rust-focussed, while the latter one will be more project-focussed, with working group meetings and the software fair.</description>

General Information The following two lists present those students that got a perfect score in each midterm, sorted by the fastest time.
There have been minor changes in the constitution of the Midterms, specifically the load in AY 2025/26 was reduced from the previous years. Additionally, from 2025/26 onwards there can be no additional material.
Only the midterms count for this list, since it&amp;rsquo;s the first time the students see the questions.</description>

        <description>CS358: PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOUNDATIONS By profs. Marco Patrignani and Marco Vassena
General Course Information How can programming language designers ensure that programmers know exactly what their programs do? Programming language (PL) theory can help answer this and similar questions precisely.
In this course, we study fundamental concepts of PL theory that are essential to the design and specification of programming languages. We will learn how to formalize fundamental concepts such as program syntax, semantics, and type systems, starting from a minimal language (lambda calculus), which we will then extend progressively with more advanced features (algebraic data types, heaps, recursion, and polymorphism) typical of many existing programming languages.</description>
